# 42_Code_A_Thon
A code challenge in Python
#Goal
In python, create an application that rates start-ups based on four criteria:
<ol>
  <li>founder rating</li>
  <li>industry rating</li>
  <li>traction rating</li>
  <li>gut rating</li>
</ol>

Each of these is given a rating from 0 to 5, with up to two decimal places. They are then manipulated into one of four scores:
<ol>
  <li>P1</li>
  <li>P2</li>
  <li>P3</li>
  <li>R</li>
</ol>

The project consists of three scripts.</br>
task1.py just gives the rating of a single startup.</br>
task2.py lets the user enter multiple startups and gives statistics on them all.</br>
task3.py uses the data from task2, and let's the user see what companies meet different criteria, and see which are worth investing in.</br>
</br>
task_bonus replicates the behaviour of all of the other tasks, this time in a gui. This was optional, but it seemed like a good application of skills learned in this project.
